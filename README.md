Please Star or watch that repo is you want to follow updates.

If you used a custom fork, or Git URL in npm, please update it if you'd like to get updates for Group Alias. Regular `npm install` uses will _not_ be affected by this change. Simply `npm update` and you're good to go!

The reason for this is because the hubot-scripts org [has been deprecated](https://github.com/hubot-scripts/packages)
